    <p>Hi there! My name’s Megan Liu. I’m a 3rd year Computer Science major at Northeastern, and I live in a town outside of Boston. 
      I’m passionate about full stack software development, the humanities, and interdisciplinary work. I’m in a club called Northeastern 
      Electric Racing, where I am a full stack software developer and was formerly a tech lead. In my spare time, I love learning foreign 
      languages, reading Wikipedia articles, listening to 80s music, and hanging out with my friends. 
    </p>
    <p>In the future, I will include the following on my website:
      <ul>
        <li>A menu box on the right hand side of this home page</li>
        <li>The menu will list the name of the home page ('Home') and also the names of many places that I have traveled to</li>
        <li>The 'Home' name is clickable and leads back to the home page</li>
        <li>Each place name is clickable and leads to a page dedicated solely to that place</li>
        <li>Each place page includes:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A written overview of that place</li>
          <li>Images (my photos) of that place</li>
          <li>Written descriptions of the images</li>
          <li>Links to more travel info about that place</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
