    <h1>80s Rock and Roll</h1>
    <img src="images/rickspringfield.jpeg" alt="The legendary 80s rock singer Rick Springfield with his electric guitar" />
    <p>The 80s was the golden age of rock music. 
        Some of the most famous singers and bands included Bon Jovi, Bryan Adams, Aerosmith, Pat Benatar, and Bruce Springsteen.
        There were so many cool varieties of electric guitars of all different colors and shapes, such as Prince's Purple Rain guitar.</p>
    <p>Some of my favorite songs from the 80s are: 
        <ul>
            <li>Jessie's Girl</li>
            <li>Summer of '69</li>
            <li>I Love Rock 'n' Roll</li>
            <li>Faithfully</li>
            <li>Pour Some Sugar on Me</li>
            <li>Another One Bites the Dust</li>
            <li>Modern Love</li>
            <li>Hurts So Good</li>
            <li>Your Love</li>
            <li>Back in Black</li>
        </ul>
